Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
select year_id,sum(sales) as total_sales from sales_order_orc where status != 'Cancelled' group by year_id;

b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
select PRODUCTLINE,productcode,sum(QUANTITYORDERED) as max_order from sales_order_orc group by PRODUCTLINE,productcode order by max_order DESC limit 1;


c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter

select year_id,QTR_ID,sum(SALES) as total_quater_sales from sales_order_orc where status != 'Cancelled' group by year_id,QTR_ID;

d. In which quarter sales was minimum
select year_id,QTR_ID,sum(SALES) as min_quater_sales from sales_order_orc where status != 'Cancelled' group by year_id,QTR_ID order by min_quater_sales ASC limit 1;

e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
select COUNTRY,MAX(sales) as max_sales,MIN(sales) as min_sales from sales_order_orc where status != 'Cancelled' group by COUNTRY;

f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city

select CITY,year_id,QTR_ID,SUM(sales) as city_total_sales_quater from sales_order_orc where status != 'Cancelled' group by CITY, year_id, QTR_ID;


h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold

select MAX(QUANTITYORDERED) max_quantity,year_id,MONTH_ID from sales_order_orc where status != 'Cancelled' group by year_id,MONTH_ID;
